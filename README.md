# `nasty` Notifications

`nasty` Notifications is a command line tool to help create [eww widgets](https://github.com/elkowar/eww).

This is mainly accomplished by providing long running commands that `eww` "listens" to. 
Eww integration examples can be found in my 
[`.dotfiles`](https://github.com/KGB33/.dotfiles/blob/cf8317d8bb4ef33903339199218edba490847441/.config/eww/workspaces.yuck#L1)

See `nasty --help` for cli usage.
